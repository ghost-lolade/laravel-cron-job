To auto-starting Laravel Scheduler, we require to set Cron Job that executes after every minute.ssh into your server, get inside your project with cd laravel-project-name and run the following commandcrontab -eBashCopyIt will open the Crontab file, and you need to assimilate the following code in the same file.Don’t forget to replace /path/to/artisan with the full path to the custom Artisan command of the Laravel project.* * * * * cd /your-project-path && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1.propertiesCopySummaryThe primary focus of this tutorial is to understand the boundless opportunities of Laravel 7 Task Scheduler. It brings lots of options to the table, such as creating commands, building logics, and custom task schedulers.
